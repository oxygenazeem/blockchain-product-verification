# Blockchain Product Verification

### Welcome to my project, the Blockchain Product Verification! The following project is crypto-based, being fully powered by the crypto wallet MetaMask. 

## Why use this?

### This ensures maximum safety when it comes to product manufacturing. A blockchain ensures that the following product has NOT been altered. 

## How does it work?

### A product ID is entered within the system. The system will check if the device has MetaMask, through which it will ask for a transaction fee. This fee is incredibly low, as it mostly consists of the gas fee required to transfer data to the crypto blockchain. Once the blockchain has received the new ID, it generates a QR code for it. This QR code can be really beneficial, especially in the use of receipts. 

## How does it verify?

### You can verify by scanning the code or by manually typing in the Product ID. In doing so, the MetaMask blockchain is accessed for data, from where it searches for the same ID number.

## What makes it a "blockchain"?

### One of the languages used in this program is Solidity. This code has been compiled and deployed as a contract to the MetaMask provider. As a result, the contract, which holds this blockchain, is fully permanent.

## What makes it safe?

### Most current businesses may use MySQL or other languages to manually write down a database on the back-end. This is very unsafe as data can be breached, tampered with, and even removed. My project aims to fix this by using a crypto-powered blockchain. This data is beneficial for data conservation for both the short-term and the long-term. No data can ever be removed or deleted, making it permanent forever. No data can be tampered with, as if it were to have been tampered with, the other data entries won't add up, giving it the name "blockchain".

# Notice:

## - The program will not function without the MetaMask extension on a computer or the dApps built-in browser within the MetaMask for mobile.
## - The use of real cryptocurrencies is unfavored, as this is a simple simulation. Please use a testnet or a fake crypto network. (Sepolia is the best as it has been tested on)
