Welcome to my project, the Blockchain Product Verification! The following project is crypto-based, being fully powered by the crypto wallet MetaMask. 

Why use this?

This ensures maximum safety when it comes to product manufacturing. A blockchain ensures that the following product has NOT been altered. 

How does it work?

A product ID is entered within the system. The system will check if the device has MetaMask, through which it will ask for a transaction fee. This fee is incredibly low, as it mostly consists of the gas fee required to transfer data to the crypto blockchain.
